            <h2>Limits</h2>
            <p>
                Limits are anything a participant is not interested in. They might be Soft (something the sub feels vervous about, but may willing to try), or hard (Absoloutly off limits).

                 A hard limit may be a certain fetish, a tool (ex. belt, whip), certain names or words (ex. loser, dirty, faggot etc.)  A hard limit may be something that is triggering, so it's vital that these are respected.

                 Soft limits should be treated with just as much respect. Imagine how you might feel about someone pushing you to do something you are nervous about. If you have a bad experiance with it, or try somehting too quickly, it could become a hard limit and you might miss out on all the benefits you could have found from that form of play in the future.

            <h2>Safe words</h2>
            <p>Here are some basic safewords that are commonly used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="red">
                    Red:
                    <p>Stop everything now, "I've reached my limit"</p>
                </li>
                <li class="yellow">
                    Yellow:
                    <p>Pause, "I want to discuss or change somehting"</p>
                </li>
                <li class="green">
                    Green:
                    <p>
                        "I like what's happening"
                    </p>
                    <li class="blue">
                        Blue:
                        <p>"I'd like things to get a little more intense"</p>
                    </li>
            </ul>

        <div id="impact" class="topic">
            <h2>Impact play:</h2>
            <p>
                What is it? Spanking, flogging, paddles, whips, cane, crop, etc.<br/> some less comon forms are punching, kicking and face slapping. Start light and slow, working up to a harder impact. Mix things up by changing the intensity, the tool
                you're using and where you're hitting. The submissive can rate each impact on how much it hurts (1=light, 10=too hard), This can help the dominant gauge what feels good to the sub.</p>

            Be careful of wrapping. When a whip or flogger wraps around a body part the force of its impact becomes significantly harder.
            <p>
                <b>where to hit:</b> ass, breasts, thighs, bottom of feet (very sensitive). Areas that are well protected by body fat are safer.
                <b>areas to avoid:</b> Kidnies, lower back, stomach, ribs, face, neck. Striking an area with less fatty tiusue can cause
            </p>

            <h2>CBT</h2>
            <i>Cock &amp; ball torture</i>
            <p>
                When kicking, hitting, punching or otherwise impacting the balls make sure you impact them right in the center and both at once, having one impacted separately leaves the risk of complications such as tangling which can be serious. When using toys such
                as Urethral sounds use a sterile lube. Use a medium sized sound that fits comfortably in without stretching. Smaller may seem better for beginners, but often they are more dangerous and increase the risk of creating tears or damaging the
                urethral canal. Never use objects with sharp edges, or that have not been cleaned or sterilized. For beginners start slow and don't advance quickly, what may not hurt now may hurt later.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Never leave a submissive alone while unable to speak.</b> IF you are leaving them bound while you're not present, discuss emergency safety measures (ex. a phone nearby and a key within reach).

        <div id="rope" class="topic">
            <h2>Rope bondage:</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Never tie over a pulse point. </b> This will restrict blood flow.<br/> *IF* you are going to (ex. wrists, ankles), leave a gap of two fingers width between rope and skin. Movement, even small ones like ocasionally rotating one wrist
                over the other, will help with circulation if the bottom isn't completely imobilized.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Check in frequently.</b> Ask whomever is tied how their hands, feet or whatever are feeling.<br/> Numbness or a "pins and needles" sensation can mean blood isn't flowing to that area;
                <i>Loss of circulation can lead to perminent nerve damage.</i><br/> If they feel <b>any</b> numbness, untie them right away.<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep a set of safety shears (EMT utility scisors) close incase you need to cut them free. They look like bent scisors that are blunt on the end so they wont cut a person. You can find them at a pharmacy.<br/>
